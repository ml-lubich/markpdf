## Documentation Conventions

### Code Examples

All code examples use TypeScript and assume you're working within the markpdf codebase.

### File Paths

File paths are relative to the project root unless otherwise specified.

### Terminology

- **Service**: A class that encapsulates business logic and coordinates with dependencies
- **Layer**: A grouping of related components (Presentation, Application, Domain, Service, Infrastructure)
- **Workflow**: A sequence of steps that accomplish a task (e.g., conversion workflow)
- **Resource**: A system resource (browser, server, temp files) that requires cleanup

## Contributing to Documentation
